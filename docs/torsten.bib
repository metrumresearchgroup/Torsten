	abstract = {As myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity for most chemotherapeutic drugs, modelers attempt to find relationships between drug and toxicity to optimize treatment. Mechanistic models, i.e. models based on physiology and pharmacology, are preferable over empirical models, as prior information can be utilized and as they generally are more reliable for extrapolations. To account for different dosing-regimens and possible schedule-dependent effects, the whole concentration–time profile should be used as input into the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic model. It is also of importance to model the whole time course of myelosuppression to be able to predict both the degree and duration of toxicity as well as consecutive courses of therapy. A handful of (semi)-mechanistic pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic models with the above properties have been developed and are reviewed. Ideally, a model of myelosuppression should separate drug-specific parameters from system related parameters to be applicable across drugs and useful under different clinical settings. Introduction of mechanistic models of myelosuppression in the design and evaluation of clinical trials can guide in the decision of optimal sampling times, contribute to knowledge of optimal doses and treatment regimens at an earlier time point and identify sub-groups of patients at a high risk of myelosuppression.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

	abstract = {This book is a text for a one-semester course for upper-level undergraduates and beginning graduate students in engineering, science, and mathematics. Prerequisites are a first course in the theory of ODEs and a survey course in numerical analysis, in addition to specific programming experience, preferably in MATLAB, and knowledge of elementary matrix theory. Professionals will also find that this useful concise reference contains reviews of technical issues and realistic and detailed examples. The programs for the examples are supplied on the accompanying web site and can serve as templates for solving other problems. Each chapter begins with a discussion of the "facts of life" for the problem, mainly by means of examples. Numerical methods for the problem are then developed, but only those methods most widely used. The treatment of each method is brief and technical issues are minimized, but all the issues important in practice and for understaning the codes are discussed. The last part of each chapter is a tutorial that shows how to solve problems by means of small, but realistic, examples.},
