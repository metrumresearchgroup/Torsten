# Solving Algebraic Equations  {#algebra-solver.chapter}

Stan provides a built-in mechanism for specifying systems of algebraic equations.
These systems can be solved either with the Newton method,
as implemented in the Kinsol package [@Hindmarsh:2005],
or with the Powell hybrid method [@Powell:1970].
The function signatures for Stan's algebraic solvers are fully
described in the algebraic solver section of the reference manual.

Solving any system of algebraic equations can be translated into a root-finding
problem, that is, given a function $f$, we wish to find $y$ such that
$f(y) = 0$.

## Example: system of nonlinear algebraic equations

For systems of linear algebraic equations, we recommend solving the system
using matrix division. The algebraic solver becomes handy when we want
to solve nonlinear equations.

As an illustrative example, we consider the following nonlinear system of two equations
with two unknowns:
\begin{align*}
z_1 &= y_1 - \theta_1 \\
z_2 &= y_1 y_2 + \theta_2
\end{align*}

Our goal is to simultaneously solve all equations for
$y_1$ and $y_2$, such that the vector $z$ goes to 0.

## Coding an algebraic system

A system of algebraic equations is coded directly in Stan as a
function with a strictly specified signature. For example, the
nonlinear system given above can be coded using the
following function in Stan (see the [user-defined functions
section](user-functions.qmd) for more information on coding
user-defined functions).

```stan
vector system(vector y,              // unknowns
              vector theta,          // parameters
              data array[] real x_r, // data (real)
              array[] int x_i) {     // data (integer)
  vector[2] z;
  z[1] = y[1] - theta[1];
  z[2] = y[1] * y[2] - theta[2];
  return z;
}
```

The function takes the unknowns we wish to solve for in `y` (a
vector), the system parameters in `theta` (a vector), the real
data in `x_r` (a real array) and the integer data in `x_i`
(an integer array). The system function returns the value of the
function (a vector), for which we want to compute the roots. Our
example does not use real or integer data. Nevertheless, these unused
arguments must be included in the system function with exactly the
signature above.

The body of the system function here could also be coded using a row
vector constructor and transposition,

```stan
return [ y[1] - theta[1],
         y[1] * y[2] - theta[2] ]';
```

As systems get more complicated, naming the intermediate expressions
goes a long way toward readability.



#### Strict signature {-}

The function defining the system must have exactly these argument types and
return type. This may require passing in zero-length arrays for data or a zero-length
vector for parameters if the system does not involve data or parameters.

## Calling the algebraic solver

Let's suppose $\theta = (3, 6)$. To call the algebraic solver, we need to
provide an initial guess. This varies on a case-by-case basis, but in general
a good guess will speed up the solver and, in pathological cases, even determine
whether the solver converges or not. If the solver does not converge, the Metropolis
proposal gets rejected and a warning message, stating no acceptable solution was
found, is issued.

The solver has three tuning parameters to determine convergence: the
relative tolerance, the function tolerance, and the maximum number of
steps.  Their behavior is explained in
the section about [algebraic solvers with control
parameters](algebraic-equations.qmd#algebra-control.section).

The following code returns the solution to our nonlinear algebraic system:

```stan
transformed data {
  vector[2] y_guess = [1, 1]';
  array[0] real x_r;
  array[0] int x_i;
}

transformed parameters {
  vector[2] theta = [3, 6]';
  vector[2] y;

  y = solve_newton(system, y_guess, theta, x_r, x_i);
}
```

which returns $y = (3, -2)$.

### Data versus parameters {-}
The arguments for the real data `x_r` and
the integer data `x_i` must be expressions that only involve data or
transformed data variables. `theta`, on the other hand,
must only involve parameters. Note there are no restrictions on the initial guess,
`y_guess`, which may be a data or a parameter vector.

### Length of the algebraic function and of the vector of unknowns {-}
The Jacobian of the solution with respect to the parameters is computed
using the implicit function theorem, which imposes certain restrictions. In particular,
the Jacobian of the algebraic function $f$ with respect to the unknowns $x$ must
be invertible. This requires the Jacobian to be square, meaning $f(y)$ and
$y$ have the same length or, in other words *the number of equations in
the system is the same as the number of unknowns.*

### Pathological solutions {-}
Certain systems may be degenerate, meaning they have multiple solutions. The
algebraic solver will not report these cases, as the algorithm stops once it has found
an acceptable solution. The initial guess will often determine which solution gets found
first. The degeneracy may be broken by putting additional constraints on the solution.
For instance, it might make "physical sense" for a solution to be positive or negative.

On the other hand, a system may not have a solution (for a given point in the parameter
space). In that case, the solver will not converge to a solution. When the solver fails to
do so, the current Metropolis proposal gets rejected.

## Control parameters for the algebraic solver {#algebra-control.section}

The call to the algebraic solver shown previously uses the default control settings. The `_tol` variant of the solver function
allows three additional parameters, all of which must be supplied.

```stan
y = solve_newton_tol(system, y_guess, theta, x_r, x_i,
                     scaling_step, f_tol, max_steps);
```

For the Newton solver the three control arguments are scaling step, function tolerance, and maximum number of steps. For the Powell's hybrid method the three control arguments are relative tolerance, function tolerance, and maximum number of steps. If a Newton step is smaller than the scaling step tolerance, the code breaks, assuming the solver is no longer making significant progress. If set to 0, this constraint is ignored. For Powell's hybrid method the relative tolerance is the estimated relative error of the solver and serves to test if a satisfactory solution has been found. After convergence of the either solver, the proposed solution
is plugged into the algebraic system and its norm is compared to the function tolerance. If the norm is below the function tolerance, the solution is deemed acceptable.  If the solver solver reaches the maximum number of steps, it stops and returns an error message. If one of the criteria is not met, the
Metropolis proposal gets rejected with a warning message explaining which criterion
was not satisfied. 


The default values for the control arguments are respectively
`scaling_step = 1e-3` ($10^{-3}$), `rel_tol = 1e-10` ($10^{-10}$), `f_tol = 1e-6` ($10^{-6}$), and `max_steps = 200` ($200$).

### Tolerance {-}

The relative and function tolerances control the accuracy of the solution generated by
the solver. Relative tolerances are relative to the solution value. The function tolerance
is the norm of the algebraic function, once we plug in the proposed solution. This norm
should go to 0 (equivalently, all elements of the vector function are 0). It helps to think about this
geometrically. Ideally the output of the algebraic function is at the origin; the norm measures
deviations from this ideal. As the length of the return vector increases, a certain
function tolerance becomes an increasingly difficult criterion to meet, given each
individual element of the vector contribute to the norm.

Smaller relative tolerances produce more accurate solutions but require more computational time.

#### Sensitivity analysis {-}

The tolerances should be set low enough that setting them lower does not change the
statistical properties of posterior samples generated by the Stan program. The sensitivity can be analysed using importance sampling without need to re-run MCMC with different tolerances as shown by @Timonen+etal:2023:ODE-PSIS.

### Maximum number of steps {-}

The maximum number of steps can be used to stop a runaway simulation. This can arise in
MCMC when a bad jump is taken, particularly during warmup. If the limit is hit, the
current Metropolis proposal gets rejected. Users will see a  warning message stating the
maximum number of steps has been exceeded.
