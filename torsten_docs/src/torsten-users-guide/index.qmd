This is the official user's guide for
[Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten).  It
provides function references, and model examples for coding statistical models in Torsten.

We also thank the Stan Development Team for giving us guidance on how to
create new Stan functions and adding features to Stan's core language
that facilitate building ODE-based models.  We also thank Kyle Baron and Hunter Ford for helpful advice on coding
in C++ and using GitHub, Curtis Johnston for reviewing the User
Manual, and Yaming Su for using Torsten and giving us feedback.

<!-- - Part 1 gives Stan code and discussions for several important classes -->
<!-- of models. -->

<!-- - Part 2 discusses various general Stan programming techniques that are -->
<!-- not tied to any particular model. -->

<!-- - Part 3 introduces algorithms for calibration and model checking that -->
<!-- require multiple runs of Stan. -->

<!-- - The appendices provide an introduction to the stanc3 compiler used in the -->
<!--   various interfaces to Stan, a style guide, and advice for users of BUGS and -->
<!--   JAGS. -->
