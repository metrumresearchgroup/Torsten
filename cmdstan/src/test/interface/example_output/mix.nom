Checking sampler transitions treedepth.
Treedepth satisfactory for all transitions.

Checking sampler transitions for divergences.
No divergent transitions found.

Checking E-BFMI - sampler transitions HMC potential energy.
E-BFMI satisfactory for all transitions.

The following parameters had fewer than 0.001 effective draws per transition:
  mu[1], mu[2], theta
Such low values indicate that the effective sample size estimators may be biased high and actual performance may be substantially lower than quoted.

The following parameters had split R-hat greater than 1.05:
  mu[1], mu[2], theta
Such high values indicate incomplete mixing and biasedestimation.
You should consider regularizating your model with additional prior information or a more effective parameterization.

Processing complete.
