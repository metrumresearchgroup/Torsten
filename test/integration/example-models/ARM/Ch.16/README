Data

radon.data.R
Source: radon measurements coordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency
in a random sample of more than 80,000 houses throughout the country.
The dataset is restricted to the 85 counties in Minnesota.
- N          : number of observations
- J          : number of counties
- y          : logarithm of the radon measurement in house i, i = 1,...,N
- x          : the floor of the measurement
               0: basement
               1: first floor
- county     : county id, 1,...,J
- county_name: county name
- u          : measurement of soil uranium in county j, j = 1,...,J
