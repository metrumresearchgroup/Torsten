# Bayesian Population Analysis using WinBUGS

Models from the book "Bayesian Population Analysis using WinBUGS --- A Hierarchical Perspective" (2012) by Marc Kéry and Michael Schaub.

Original BUGS code and data files are available at [the website of the book](http://www.vogelwarte.ch/de/projekte/publikationen/bpa/complete-code-and-data-files-of-the-book.html).

Stan translations was done by Hiroki Itô <abies.firma@gmail.com>. I thank Dr. Kéry and Dr. Schaub for permitting to publish Stan translated models. I also thank Dr. Keiichi Fukaya for helpful advice, and Dr. Bob Carpenter for reviewing the code.
