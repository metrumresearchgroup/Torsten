Data
====

1. radon.data.R
Source: radon measurements coordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency
in a random sample of more than 80,000 houses throughout the country.
The dataset is restricted to the 85 counties in Minnesota.
- N          : number of observations
- J          : number of counties
- y          : logarithm of the radon measurement in house i, i = 1,...,N
- x          : the floor of the measurement
               0: basement
               1: first floor
- county     : county id, 1,...,J
- county_name: county name
- u          : measurement of soil uranium in county j, j = 1,...,J

2. weight.data.R
- N     : number of observations
- weight: weight in pounds
- height: height in inches

3. weight_censored.data.R
- N     : total number of observations
- N_obs : number of uncensored observations (true weight)
- N_cens: number of censored observations (weight = 200 if weight >= 200)
- C     : 200
- weight: censored weight in pounds
- height: height in inches

4. weight_lt200.data.R
Subset of weight.data.R: only weight < 200

Models
======

1. radon.1.stan: varying intercept multilevel model

2. radon.pooling.stan: complete pooling model

3. radon.nopooling.stan: no pooling model

4. radon.2.stan: multilevel model with group-level predictors

5. weight.stan: weight ~ c_height
where c_height <- height - mean(height)

6. weight_censored.stan: weight ~ c_height, allowing for censoring
