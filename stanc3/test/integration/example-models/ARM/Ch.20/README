1. Multilevel model with varying intercept and slope
  hiv.stan: lmer(y ~ 1 + (1 + time | person))

2. Multilevel model with group level predictors and interaction
  hiv_inter.stan: lmer(y ~ time:treatment + (1 + time | person))

3. Above models with Matt trick
  hiv_chr.stan      : lmer(y ~ 1 + (1 + time | person))
  hiv_inter_chr.stan: lmer(y ~ time:treatment + (1 + time | person))
